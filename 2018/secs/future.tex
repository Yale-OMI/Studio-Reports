\section{Moving forward}

OMI will continue to support the many facets of computer music at Yale through weekly workshops, reading groups and through associated research projects. Specifically, we will focus on developing low-level DSP on Bela boards and DSP development over cloud computation frameworks. OMI will also continue its biannual concert series to provide faculty and students a regular, ongoing venue for their creative work. OMI also looks to foster inter-track collaboration within the C2 program to find new applications of computer music in other artistic domains. Additional information about OMI can be found at \url{https://omi.yale.edu}.
