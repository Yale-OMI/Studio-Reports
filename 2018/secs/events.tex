The OMI membership designs and coordinates a series of workshops that are offered over the course of the academic year at both the introductory and advanced level. Attendees typically represent a broad cross-section of schools and departments at Yale as well as local artists from the community. In the workshops, OMI members introduce relevant concepts and technologies in topics. In the fall of 2018, topics included: building an LM386 amplifier circuit, basic theory of DSP and DSP programming in JUCE~\cite{juce}, hacking ``found'' hardware, and an introduction to Arduino and sensor networks.

In December 2018, OMI hosted a computer music concert showcasing work from students and faculty in the CCAM. The concert featured live electronics improvisation using analog and digital synthesizers, live coding, performances with interactive processing, and pieces utilizing eight-channel sound spatialization. A selection of the hardware used for this concert is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:concert}.
